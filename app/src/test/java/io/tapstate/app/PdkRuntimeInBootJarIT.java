/**
 * Guards that the host half of the PDK is actually packaged into the shipped boot jar, not merely
 * present on a test classpath.
 *
 * <p>Connectors are built against these libraries and do not carry them: they declare them
 * {@code provided}, meaning whoever hosts the connector has them, and the connector loader delegates
 * all of {@code io.tapdata} to the host. A server whose boot jar omits one is a server where affected
 * connectors half-work — they load, they connect, and they fail on the first call that reaches a class
 * from the missing library. Neither library is referenced by any app source, so both look unused to
 * anyone reading the pom, and neither absence fails a build.
 *
 * <p>What the packaged artifact is inspected for, rather than the classpath: a test fork carries
 * runtime- and test-scope entries alike, so a witness that drives a real connector stays green whether
 * the dependency ships or not. Downgrading either entry to test scope, or dropping it as unused,
 * removes it from {@code BOOT-INF/lib} and reds here. Runs on every build that packages the boot jar
 * (no database, no external jar); skips only when no boot jar was produced.
