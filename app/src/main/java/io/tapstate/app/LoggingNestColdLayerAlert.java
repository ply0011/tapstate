/**
 * Says that a nest namespace has stopped being served from memory, and later that it is again.
 *
 * <p>This is the whole of the signal. A namespace whose working set has outgrown the memory it is given
 * goes on reporting short queues, flat lag and steady throughput while every event it handles has become a
 * round trip to storage — per-key state fills no edge queue, so there is nothing for backpressure to push
 * back on and nothing else that moves. Nobody is going to notice this by watching, so it is said.
 *
 * <p>The crossing is coded and the recovery is not, because there is no severity that means "this is fine"
 * and dressing an all-clear as a warning would be worse than not coding it. The recovery names the code
 * anyway: whoever went looking did so by the code, and a withdrawal their search does not return is a
 * withdrawal they never read.
 *
 * <p>Numbers are formatted in a fixed locale rather than the process default. Which locale a server boots
 * under is nobody's deliberate choice, and a decimal comma is not cosmetic in a line that gets grepped.
