/**
 * The {@code actuation} domain's error codes: the assembly root failing to resolve a pipeline's runnable
 * topology from its stored artifact when a start actuates it. A desired-to-run pipeline whose artifact is
 * absent, or an id that names a resource of another kind, is a user-facing, diagnosable failure carried
 * through the error-code system and rendered through the shared message catalog - distinct from the
 * {@code engine} domain, which polices operating the Jet job once the topology is built.
 *
 * <p>{@code placeholders()} is the named-argument contract: every throw site supplies a value for each
 * name, and the build-time placeholder gate checks the catalog templates against it.
