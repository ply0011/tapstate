/**
 * The {@code alias} verb, driven the way a user drives it. {@link AliasLinksTest} covers what a link
 * must be; this covers the command around it — that both halves are reachable from the command line,
 * that each says which directory it acted on, and that a directory holding no {@code tapstate} entry
 * is refused rather than silently managed.
 *
 * <p>The install directory is located through {@code user.home} here because the environment variable
 * the command also honours cannot be set from inside a running JVM. The default path is the one a user
 * who never set that variable takes, so it is the branch worth pinning.
