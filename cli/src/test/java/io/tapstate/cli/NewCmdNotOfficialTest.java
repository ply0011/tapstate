/**
 * Naming a connector the catalog carries but this release does not install is its own refusal, apart
 * from naming one that does not exist at all. Reporting the second for the first is untrue — the id
 * is right there in the catalog — and it flattens two situations a user resolves differently: fixing
 * a typo, versus learning this build does not ship that connector.
