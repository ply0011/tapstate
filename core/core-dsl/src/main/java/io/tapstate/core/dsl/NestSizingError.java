 * The {@code nest} domain's authoring-time capacity codes: what sizing a nest against the memory it
 * will run on has to say to the author writing it. They are warnings — a batch carrying one is applied,
 * and the pipeline it describes runs.
 *
 * <p>They live apart from the domain's runtime codes because the ring that judges a batch cannot reach
 * the ring that runs one, the same split the {@code connector} domain already carries between loading a
 * connector and cataloguing one. The domain is shared, so the codes are still one namespace and still
 * globally unique.
 *
 * <p>{@code placeholders()} is the named-argument contract: every raise site supplies a value for each
 * name, and the build-time placeholder gate checks the catalog templates against it.
