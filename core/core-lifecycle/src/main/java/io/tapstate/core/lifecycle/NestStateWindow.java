/**
 * What one namespace of a nest's state did between two readings, as opposed to what it has done since the
 * run began.
 *
 * <p>A reading carries counts that run from when the member came up, and the ratio that matters here cannot
 * be taken from one of them: it would be an average over the whole run, which is the one window in which a
 * namespace that fell off its cliff a minute ago still reads as healthy. A day of serving everything from
 * memory drowns an hour of serving nothing from it. So the counted halves are differenced across two
 * readings and only the interval between them is described.
 *
 * <p>The two gauges are not differenced. {@code entries} and {@code stored} are how much there is now, not
 * how much there has been; their difference would say how much the namespace grew, which is a different
 * question from how much of it can be answered without going to disk.
 *
 * <p>Counters that came back smaller than last time are read as a run that started over rather than as
 * negative traffic. They live on the member and are dropped when a pipeline lets go of its namespace, so a
 * pipeline stopped and started again genuinely does report smaller numbers than before; subtracting would
 * produce a negative over a negative, which is a ratio that can read like anything at all.
 *
 * @param accesses how many times the state was reached for during the window, read or written
 * @param backfills how many of those found nothing in memory and went to the layer behind
 * @param backfillMillis how long those took in total
 * @param entries how many keys the namespace holds in memory as of the later reading
 * @param stored how many keys there are altogether as of the later reading, where there is a layer to ask
