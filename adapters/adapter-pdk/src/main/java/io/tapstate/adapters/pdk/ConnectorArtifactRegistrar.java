/**
 * Registers a connector artifact on disk into the distribution store by what the artifact itself
 * declares: self-scan supplies the entry class and PDK API version, the spec's {@code properties.id}
 * supplies the connector id, and the artifact bytes go through the store's content-hash idempotent
 * register-if-absent. The startup seed sweep and the explicit runtime register operation are both
 * this one call, differing only in the {@link RegistrationSource} they record.
 *
 * <p>An artifact whose spec cannot yield an id — not valid JSON, or no {@code properties.id} — is
 * refused with a coded connector-domain exception: registration would have no identity to file the
 * artifact under. A different artifact under an already-registered id is likewise refused — a single
 * active artifact is kept per id. A raw I/O failure reading the artifact is not a connector defect and
 * surfaces as an unchecked I/O exception.
 *
 * <p>After the bytes are registered, the connector's normalized catalog row is derived (its declared
 * capabilities merged with its spec) and stored, so the online catalog view can list the connector and
 * validate against it. Derivation is skipped when the bytes were already registered and a row already
 * exists; a re-register whose row is missing backfills it, so a crash between the two never leaves a
 * registered connector without a row.
