/**
 * Watches each chain's pinned-for reading go by and says when one has been pinned too long, and when it
 * is moving again.
 *
 * <p>What it holds is whether each chain it has seen was over the last time it looked, because what is
 * reported is the two edges rather than the state. A position pinned for a day is one thing that happened,
 * not one thing per pass, and saying it every pass would drown the record it is written to; saying only
 * the entry would leave the last thing anyone heard being wrong for as long as the recovery lasts.
 *
 * <p>The duration does the judging and the distance rides along, because they answer different halves of
 * one question: how long says the position is pinned at all — which the distance cannot, reading zero both
 * for a chain held back by pending changes and for one keeping up — and the distance says which of the two
 * pins it is, and therefore which end to work on. A chain reporting no distance keeps that absence rather
 * than being given a zero; it has never advanced, which is the worse case, not the resting one.
 *
 * <p>A chain that stops being reported is dropped rather than called recovered. It has either caught up
 * or its job has stopped, and those are indistinguishable from here while meaning opposite things — a
 * stopped job's durable position is pinned exactly where it was, and the retention window goes on being
 * consumed while nothing at all is running. Announcing recovery there would be the single belief this
 * alarm exists to prevent. The ordinary recovery still reports: a chain that advances is reported again
 * with its duration restarted, and falling back under the threshold is the edge.
 *
 * <p>Chains are held under their pipeline rather than under a name built from both. A chain is named for
 * the table it carries, so two pipelines reading the same table would otherwise be judged against each
 * other's readings — and a joined name would answer that with a separator that has to be absent from every
 * pipeline id there will ever be.
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe, and does not need to be: it is fed from the pass that publishes observations, which
 * is one caller at a time.
