/**
 * Watches each nest namespace's readings go by and says when one stops being served from memory.
 *
 * <p>What it holds is the previous reading of every namespace it has seen, because the counts in a reading
 * run from the beginning of the run and the question is about now. Two readings and the interval between
 * them are the smallest thing that can answer it.
 *
 * <p>It reports the two edges rather than the state. A condition that holds for a day is one thing that
 * happened, not one thing per pass, and reporting it per pass would drown the record it is written to;
 * reporting the entry alone would leave the last thing anyone heard being wrong for however long the
 * recovery lasts.
 *
 * <p>A namespace that stops appearing is dropped rather than called recovered — a pipeline that stopped did
 * not start being served from memory again. Both what was held for it and whether it was over are dropped
 * together, so a namespace that comes back is judged from its own counts. Keeping only the reading would be
 * worse than keeping neither: the next run would be measured against a dead one's totals, and a run that
 * was over from its first reading would be silently taken for the old one still being over.
 *
 * <p>Namespaces are held under their pipeline rather than under a name built from both. Namespaces are
 * named from what a pipeline compiles to, so two pipelines running nests of the same shape would otherwise
 * be differenced against each other's counts — and a joined name would answer that with a separator that
 * has to be absent from every pipeline id there will ever be.
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe, and does not need to be: it is fed from the pass that publishes observations, which
 * is one caller at a time.
