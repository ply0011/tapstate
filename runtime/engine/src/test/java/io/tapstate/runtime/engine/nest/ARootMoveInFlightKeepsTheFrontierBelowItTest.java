/**
 * A whole document parked while its root row changes key has to keep the durable frontier below the change
 * that started the move, for as long as it sits there.
 *
 * <p>The exclusion already exists for a subtree between two documents, and this is the same bucket - but it
 * is reached by a different path and so is witnessed on its own. Here the rows in flight are <em>the whole
 * document</em>: the key that held them has been deleted and the key that will hold them has not taken them.
 * Let the frontier past the rename and a restart resumes above it, so nothing replays the rename, nothing
 * collects what was parked, and an entire document is gone from both keys with the job RUNNING and every
 * count reading healthy.
 *
 * <p>The second test is what stops the first from being satisfied by holding forever, which would pin the
 * frontier on every rename ever made. The third says the hold is released by the landing rather than by this
 * instance being the one that landed it - which for a root move is not an edge case but the normal shape,
 * since old key and new key are by construction different values of the partition key.
