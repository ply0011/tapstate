/**
 * The bound on what one document may keep to say its elements were deleted, and the sweep that keeps it far
 * from being reached.
 *
 * <p>These two belong in one place because the limit only means what it says when the sweep is what stands
 * in front of it. A record of a deletion is kept until a restart could no longer replay the deletion, so a
 * healthy pipeline drops them continuously however much deleting it does, and the only way to accumulate
 * them is a durable position that has stopped advancing. Weigh the count without dropping first and the
 * limit reports something else entirely - that this vertex has been busy - which is both a failed job for no
 * reason and the real condition going unreported.
 *
 * <p>Failed rather than dropped once it is genuinely reached. Every other bound here can be answered by
 * giving something up, and this one cannot: what would be given up is the record that stops a deleted row
 * coming back at the next restart, and nothing downstream could ever notice that it did.
