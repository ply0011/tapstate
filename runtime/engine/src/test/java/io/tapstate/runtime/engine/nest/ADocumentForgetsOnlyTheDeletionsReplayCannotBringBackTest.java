/**
 * When a document may stop keeping the record that an element was deleted. The record is what makes a
 * deletion survive a replay - an insert delivered again lands below it and is refused - so it may go only
 * once that replay can no longer happen, which is what the position a restart would resume from says.
 *
 * <p>Late costs one entry until the next sweep; early is a row the source deleted coming back and staying
 * back, with nothing anywhere reporting it. So every way of not knowing keeps it: a chain whose floor cannot
 * be read, a deletion that arrived carrying no position of its own, a deletion still holding a subtree
 * beneath it.
 *
 * <p>The subtree is not a detail of the gate but most of it. What hangs beneath a deleted element is kept on
 * purpose, because nothing will ever resend those rows, and dropping the element they hang from takes them
 * with it. A deletion is therefore forgotten from the bottom up: children first, and the element that held
 * them only once there is nothing left under it.
