/**
 * A subtree parked between documents has to keep the durable frontier below the change that started the
 * move, for as long as it sits there.
 *
 * <p>It is the same shape as a document a window is holding back and it fails the same way, but it is a
 * separate exclusion because the reason differs. A folded document is somewhere durable and simply has
 * nobody left to send it; a parked subtree is in <em>no document at all</em> - the one that had those rows
 * has let them go, and the one that will have them has not taken them. Let the frontier past and a restart
 * resumes above the change that moved the element: nothing replays the move, nothing collects what was
 * parked, and the rows are gone from both documents with the job RUNNING and no error counted anywhere.
 *
 * <p>The pair of tests is what makes this mean anything. Holding the bound down forever would be trivially
 * "safe" and would pin the frontier on every move ever made, so the second test is the one that says the
 * hold is released - and released by the hand-over landing, not by time passing.
 *
 * <p>The third says <em>wherever</em> it landed. The two documents are on different partitions, so the
 * instance that let a subtree go and the instance that takes it in are in the normal case not the same one,
 * and the first two tests cannot tell that apart from a local arrangement.
