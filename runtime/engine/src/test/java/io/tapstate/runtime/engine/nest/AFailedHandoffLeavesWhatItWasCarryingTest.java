/**
 * What a drain leaves behind when the durable half of a hand-over fails.
 *
 * <p>A drain persists every entry it touched as it ends, and does so whether it ended by running out of
 * items or by throwing - which is what makes the order inside a hand-over load-bearing. Read the rows out
 * of an entry first and the entry is empty in memory; if publishing them then fails, that empty entry is
 * what gets stored. The rows are in no entry and in no parking area, and a replay cannot bring them back:
 * the order was already applied, so the same change arriving again is rejected as one already seen. Nothing
 * counts it and no document is missing anything a test could assert on - the rows simply never existed.
 *
 * <p>So the publish comes first and the entry is emptied only once it landed. A failure then costs a retry
 * that parks the same rows twice, which the element identities make harmless, rather than the rows.
