/**
 * A hand-over goes into the parking area in pieces the deployment sizes, rather than as one value however
 * wide the tree is.
 *
 * <p>What it buys is not the write itself - a document of that width is already one entry on both sides -
 * but the second hand-over. Appending to one value means reading the whole of it back and writing the whole
 * of it out again, so a key moved repeatedly pays for everything parked before it, every time. In pieces,
 * what is rewritten is one piece.
 *
 * <p>The size is read from the settings the nest already carries and from nowhere else. A second place to
 * configure a nest is a deployment that has set half of a pair of numbers that only mean anything together.
 *
 * <p>A hand-over that fits in one piece stays one entry, which is what nearly all of them are. That is a
 * property worth pinning rather than an accident: it is what makes the common case cost exactly what it did
 * before, and what lets an entry written by an older build still be read.
