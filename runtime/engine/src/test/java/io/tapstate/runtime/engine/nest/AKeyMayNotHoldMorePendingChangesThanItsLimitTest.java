/**
 * The second quantity that fails a run rather than being absorbed by the layer behind the memory: how much
 * one key is holding for something that has not arrived.
 *
 * <p>It needs its own limit because none of the others reach it. What is kept in memory is bounded by a
 * count of entries, and everything waiting here waits <em>inside</em> one entry - a level with a single key
 * is within any budget however long that key's queue has grown. The width of a document does not reach it
 * either: what waits for an ancestor is in no document, and what a document absorbed under an absent root
 * is counted there by element while it is held here by change.
 *
 * <p><b>It fails the job rather than letting the waiting go.</b> Reaching a limit says nothing about
 * whether the parent is coming - only that a lot arrived before it did - so releasing on that evidence
 * would drop rows that were going to be part of a document, which is the harm the time limit's three-layer
 * judgement exists to avoid. Failing says the same thing out loud and leaves the rows where they are.
