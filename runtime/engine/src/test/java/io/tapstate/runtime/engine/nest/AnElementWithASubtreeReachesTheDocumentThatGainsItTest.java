/**
 * The whole of a move that crosses documents: the element arrives in one, and what hung beneath it arrives
 * with it rather than being left in the document it came from.
 *
 * <p>Neither side can do this alone. The document letting the element go is the only place those rows exist
 * - nothing will send them again - and the document gaining it is the only place they now belong, and the
 * two are reached by different keys and may be worked by different members. So the rows are read out on one
 * side, left where both can reach them, and taken in on the other.
 *
 * <p>The pair is deliberately driven through a real resolver rather than hand-built, because which of the
 * two halves is sent first is part of what makes this land, and a test that built them itself would be
 * asserting its own choice rather than the code's.
