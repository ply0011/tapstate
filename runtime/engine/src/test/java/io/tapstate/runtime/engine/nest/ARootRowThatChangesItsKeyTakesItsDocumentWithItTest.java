/**
 * The last of the structural key families: the row that changes key is the <b>root</b>, so the document
 * itself changes identity and the whole tree goes with it.
 *
 * <p>It is not a bigger version of an element moving. An element leaves a document that goes on existing;
 * a root leaves nothing behind at all - the key it was filed under names a row the source no longer has,
 * so that document has to be removed downstream, and everything it held belongs to a key that has never
 * been seen. The rows beneath are exactly the ones nothing will ever send again: the source edited one
 * row and considers the rest untouched.
 *
 * <p><b>The two halves are on different partitions by construction.</b> Old key and new key are different
 * values of the vertex's own partition key, so the instance holding the document being emptied and the
 * instance holding the one being filled are, in the normal case, two different instances - which is why
 * the pair is driven here as two processors sharing their stores rather than as one. A single-instance
 * test cannot tell "the tree was carried across" from "the tree happened to already be local".
