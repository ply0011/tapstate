/**
 * A change the window is holding back has to keep the durable frontier below it. The frontier says
 * everything at or below it is either downstream or somewhere a restart brings it back from - and a
 * document folded into an open window is neither of those two things in the one way that matters: the
 * state carrying it is written through and so survives, but <em>nothing will ever trigger that send
 * again</em>. No event is coming for that root; a restart replays from above the change; the document on
 * the sink stays at its previous version for as long as the pipeline runs, with the job RUNNING and no
 * error counted anywhere.
 *
 * <p>That is why this is asserted here and not left to the frontier's own tests: durable and
 * <em>someone will finish it</em> are two different properties, and folding is the one place a change has
 * the first without the second. Everything else this level holds has both - an element under a root that
 * has not arrived is written through with the root's state and comes out when the root does - and the last
 * test is the control that keeps this exclusion that narrow. Widening it to "anything held" would pin the
 * frontier on a dangling foreign key for as long as the job runs, which is the failure the durable state
 * was meant to remove.
