/**
 * Rows on their way between two keys are the one thing this vertex holds that is in no document at all, so
 * they are the one thing nothing else already bounds. A document is bounded by its own width and by what
 * stays in memory; a hand-over is bounded by neither, because it belongs to neither side.
 *
 * <p>Two bounds, because there are two ways for one to go wrong and they need different answers. Too much
 * at once is a structural change bigger than this deployment is set up for, and it fails the job while
 * everything is still consistent. Never collected is a half of a move that is not being worked, and time is
 * the only thing that can tell it apart from one that has not been worked <em>yet</em> - so it is given a
 * protection and then given up on.
 *
 * <p><b>Given up on means handed to the dead-letter channel, not dropped.</b> Those rows were read out of a
 * document and nothing will ever send them again, so dropping them loses data that no assertion about a
 * document could see. And the hold on the frontier goes with them: an entry given up on is no longer
 * something a replay would finish, so keeping the frontier beneath it would be waiting for what has already
 * been decided against - which is exactly how a time bound becomes unreachable.
