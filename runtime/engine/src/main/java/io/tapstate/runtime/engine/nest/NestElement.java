/**
 * One change to one element of a document: where the element belongs, the row that puts it there, the
 * order that decides whether it wins, and the positions it occupies on the chains it came from.
 *
 * <p>Everything here is settled where the change enters the tree and never recomputed on the way up.
 * That is possible because an element's place is written on its own row: the parent it hangs under is
 * the value its join key names, its own identity is the column its children will point at, and both are
 * read once at the entry vertex. What the climb resolves is only <em>which document</em> the element
 * belongs to - and that is carried beside this rather than inside it, since an element waiting for its
 * parent has no answer to it yet.
 *
 * <p>{@code fields} absent means the change removes the element rather than putting a row there; the
 * one accessor {@link #deletion()} is how that is asked, so no second flag can disagree with it.
 *
 * <p>The positions are not decoration. An element held for a parent that has not arrived has been
 * consumed and not emitted, so the durable frontier must not be allowed past it - and a bound can only
 * be reported for a position that is still here to be read. An element held without its position would
 * let the frontier claim coverage of a change that has not reached a sink, which after a restart is a
 * change that can neither be replayed nor found.
 *
 * <p>The source's own time for the change is deliberately absent. Nothing here may be decided by it: a
 * source clock can jump, repeat and run backwards, and two sources have two clocks, so ordering by it
 * would silently reorder data — {@code order} is the only thing anything is decided by. A wait here is
 * ended by a parent turning up or by that parent being known gone, never by a clock reaching some time.
 *
 * <p>The maps are copied on the way in, so a change cannot be altered from under the state holding it.
 * {@link Serializable} because a waiting bucket outlives a single run. An order is never null: a null
 * order is an engine invariant violation and crashes bare rather than being reported as a diagnosable
 * error, because comparing a missing order would silently reorder data instead.
