/**
 * Where a nest vertex writes down what killed it, before Jet is told.
 *
 * <p>A nest fails a run with a code of its own - a document wider than one may be, a hand-over parked past
 * its limit, a stream tracking key changes over a source that sends no before image - and every one of them
 * names what an operator would have to change. None of that reaches the read faces on its own: once a job's
 * terminal result is durable, Jet tears down the live context behind the job's future and reconstructs a
 * cause-free throwable from the failure's stored text, so the walk that looks for a coded cause finds none
 * and the pipeline reports the generic engine failure instead. What was a specific, actionable diagnosis
 * becomes "the job died".
 *
 * <p>The linear transform and the sink already avoid that by recording the real exception synchronously, on
 * the way out, before the rethrow reaches Jet's own tasklet machinery. The nest vertices are the two that
 * did not, which is why their codes were the ones that never arrived. This is that same recording, in one
 * place because two vertices need it.
 *
 * <p>Absent where there is no member to record onto - a processor driven directly by a test - which is not
 * a degraded mode: nothing is reading a registry there either.
