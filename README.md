# tapstate — preview

**Capture. Transform. Serve. One deployable.**

tapstate is an open-source unified operational data engine. It captures and unifies
database changes, then serves live operational state to applications and AI agents.

Instead of operating separate CDC, event-streaming, stream-processing, and serving
products, tapstate is designed to provide one data path and one operational surface:

```text
production systems -> log-based CDC -> incremental transform -> live operational state
                                                            -> pull or push consumers
```

tapstate is built for platform and data infrastructure teams that need current
business state without turning freshness into an integration project.

> From the team behind TapData, hardened through years of production CDC and real-time data movement work.

## Why tapstate

Modern systems increasingly depend on fresh operational data:

- Applications need current account, order, inventory, entitlement, and customer state.
- AI agents need up-to-date business context, not yesterday's warehouse snapshot.
- Data teams need lower-latency pipelines without adding more infrastructure to operate.
- Platform teams need correctness, recovery, and observability across the whole path.

The common answer is a hand-assembled stack:

```text
Debezium + Kafka / Redpanda + Flink / custom jobs + Redis / MongoDB / Elasticsearch
```

That stack can work, but it creates multiple failure surfaces, upgrade cycles, schemas, offsets, dashboards, and on-call paths.

tapstate brings that source-to-serve path under one product boundary. The current
preview implements a deliberately narrow slice of this direction; see
[Project status](#project-status) before evaluating it for a workload.

## Product direction

Capture, transform, and serve define tapstate's product boundary. They do not imply
that every capability below is available in the current preview.

### Capture

tapstate reads changes from production databases using log-based CDC.

- Initial load plus continuous sync
- Change metadata and ordering required to maintain downstream state
- Minimal source impact

### Transform

tapstate reshapes changes incrementally before they are served.

- Filter and route change streams
- Enrich and denormalize records
- Combine related operational data into application-ready views
- Maintain those views as source records change
- Avoid running a separate stream-processing cluster

### Serve

Serve covers both pull and push consumption of maintained operational state.

- Materialize current state into a serving store
- Query current state through standard drivers and, in future releases, data APIs
- Subscribe to state changes through future webhook and messaging adapters
- Reuse the same state across applications, automation, and AI agents

The public preview currently demonstrates materialization to MongoDB. A stable
tapstate State Data API and push/subscription delivery are roadmap capabilities,
not current guarantees.

## Try the current preview

Run the preview locally as a Docker Compose stack. The quickstart brings up MySQL,
the tapstate server, and a MongoDB-backed preview store, then drives a real snapshot
and CDC flow. One command does the whole flow in a `tapstate-demo` directory it
creates:

```sh
curl -sSL https://install.tapstate.dev | sh
```

Prefer to read it first? Download, read, then run — same script, and it works in
the directory you saved it in:

```sh
mkdir tapstate-demo && cd tapstate-demo
curl -sSL https://install.tapstate.dev -o quickstart.sh
sh quickstart.sh
```

Everything it installs stays inside that one directory; tearing down is
`docker compose down -v` in it, and `rm -rf` of the directory removes the rest.
See [docs/quickstart-online.md](docs/quickstart-online.md) for the full walkthrough
and the manual `docker compose` steps behind it.

> **Preview.** The runtime is single-node and not production-ready. Runtime state is
> in memory, and a restart replays from the source rather than resuming a durable
> offset. High availability, durable resume, and exactly-once guarantees are not
> available. `quickstart.sh` downloads a released CLI and server image. See
> [Limitations](docs/quickstart-online.md#limitations).
>
> **Recommended platform.** Docker with Compose v2, plus the system versions each
> release names in its notes: a macOS version, and a glibc version on Linux. Both are
> measured from the binaries themselves and follow the machines that built them, so an
> older system may refuse to launch them — `sw_vers -productVersion` and `ldd --version`
> say what a machine has. Nothing stops you from installing anyway: the installer names
> what the build expects and carries on, and how it goes from there is yours.

To install just the CLI — the offline authoring loop, one native binary, no Docker,
no JDK:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.tapstate.dev/cli | sh
```

It installs a preview build to `~/.tapstate/bin`, verifies the download against its
published checksum, and never asks for sudo or edits your shell configuration. Prefer
to read before you run — or to skip the pipe entirely? Both are supported:

```bash
# Audit the script first, then run the copy you read:
curl -sSL https://install.tapstate.dev/cli -o install.sh && less install.sh && sh install.sh

# Or skip the installer: download a release asset and check it yourself.
# Assets are tapstate-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz, each next to its .sha256
# (and all of them listed in the release's checksums.txt):
v=0.1.0 p=darwin-arm64   # your version, and your platform: darwin|linux, arm64|x64
curl -sSLO "https://github.com/tapstate/tapstate/releases/download/v$v/tapstate-$v-$p.tar.gz"
curl -sSLO "https://github.com/tapstate/tapstate/releases/download/v$v/tapstate-$v-$p.tar.gz.sha256"
shasum -a 256 -c "tapstate-$v-$p.tar.gz.sha256"   # sha256sum -c on Linux
tar -xzf "tapstate-$v-$p.tar.gz"
```

To uninstall: `rm -rf ~/.tapstate`, and drop the `PATH` line from your shell
configuration if you added one.

The checked-in walkthrough uses the current `tapstate/v1` DSL and verifies the
materialized state directly in MongoDB. See
[the online quickstart](docs/quickstart-online.md) for the complete resources,
commands, and CDC verification loop.

## Target use cases

- Real-time customer and account 360
- Operational data APIs
- Core system offloading
- Live master data
- Real-time analytics feeds
- Fresh context for AI agents
- Inventory, order, entitlement, and risk state

## tapstate vs. the assembled stack

| Need | Traditional stack | tapstate direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capture database changes | Debezium or custom CDC | Built-in log-based CDC |
| Move events | Kafka / Redpanda | Integrated data path |
| Transform streams | Flink / jobs / glue code | In-flight transforms |
| Serve current state | Cache / search / document DB | Maintained state with pull and push surfaces |
| Operate reliability | Multiple dashboards and failure modes | One operational surface |

Kafka moves events. Warehouses analyze history. tapstate turns database truth into
live operational state.

## Project status

tapstate is early and actively evolving. Today, the checked-in public quickstart
demonstrates:

- Offline authoring and validation of `tapstate/v1` resources
- A single-node preview runtime
- MySQL initial load plus CDC
- An in-flight map transform
- Continuous materialization to MongoDB
- Pipeline status, preview metrics, and node-local logs

The quickstart's MongoDB instance is the preview's reference backing store. It is
part of the local deployable experience, not a claim that the runtime is one binary
or that MongoDB is the only future deployment option.

The preview does not provide high availability, durable offset resume, exactly-once
delivery, a stable State Data API, or push/subscription delivery. It is not intended
for production-critical paths.

This repository is for developers, platform engineers, and data infrastructure
teams who want to try the engine, follow development, and help shape the project.

## Building and running from source

The vision above is where tapstate is going; this section is the real, working
path today. You describe the preview's implemented path — sources and pipelines
with inline transforms and MongoDB sync materialization — as small declarative
`.tap.yml` documents, and tapstate moves and reshapes the data. The repository
ships an **offline authoring
CLI** (a single native binary that creates, validates, and explores `.tap.yml`
resources with no server, database, or network) plus an early **preview runtime**
that executes those resources as live pipelines.

### Requirements

- **To run the CLI:** no runtime to install — `tapstate` is a native binary (starts in
  ~30 ms). Each build does carry a recommended system version — a macOS version, or a
  glibc version on Linux — that tracks the machine it was built on and can move between
  releases, so every release names its own in its notes. Installing on an older system is
  allowed: the installer says what the build expects and carries on; whether it launches
  there is then up to you.
- **To build from source:** **Oracle GraalVM for JDK 21** (includes `native-image`)
  and **Maven 3.6+**. A plain JDK 21 is enough to build and run the test suite;
  GraalVM is only needed for the native image.

### Build

From the repository root:

```sh
# Full build + unit tests (needs a JDK 21 toolchain)
mvn verify

# Native CLI binary (needs GraalVM for JDK 21 on JAVA_HOME)
mvn -Pnative -pl cli -am -DskipTests package
```

The native binary lands at **`cli/target/tapstate`** (the connector catalog,
grammar schema, and message text are embedded). That standalone file is enough
for offline authoring. `tapstate mcp` additionally needs the sibling sidecar,
so install the complete bundle when exposing the command globally:

```sh
# Build the native CLI and MCP Boot JAR, then assemble bin/ + libexec/.
mvn -Pnative -pl cli,control/mcp-server,distribution/cli-bundle -am -DskipTests package
tar -xzf distribution/cli-bundle/target/cli-bundle-0.1.0-native.tar.gz
mkdir -p "$HOME/.tapstate/versions/0.1.0" "$HOME/.tapstate/bin"
mv tapstate-cli-0.1.0/* "$HOME/.tapstate/versions/0.1.0/"
ln -s "$HOME/.tapstate/versions/0.1.0/bin/tapstate" "$HOME/.tapstate/bin/tapstate"
export PATH="$HOME/.tapstate/bin:$PATH"
```

The stable entry is a symlink into the versioned bundle. The launcher resolves
that link before locating `libexec`, so an MCP host can invoke `tapstate mcp`
without a repository-relative path. The release installer performs this layout
and switches the stable link atomically; it never scans Maven caches or `PATH`
for a sidecar.

Verify:

```console
$ tapstate --version
tapstate 0.1.0
```

### Quick start (offline CLI)

The offline workspace is an ordinary folder, partitioned by resource kind. Create
a source, wire it into a pipeline, and validate — all without a server:

```console
$ tapstate new -y --kind source --connector mysql --id orders_src -m cdc
created source/orders_src.tap.yml

$ tapstate new -y --kind source --connector postgres --id warehouse -m cdc
created source/warehouse.tap.yml

$ tapstate new -y --kind pipeline --id orders_sync --source orders_src --sync-to warehouse
created pipeline/orders_sync.tap.yml

$ tapstate validate
valid: 3 resources
```

Each `new` writes a deterministic, canonical `.tap.yml`:

```yaml
version: tapstate/v1
kind: source
id: orders_src
connector: mysql
mode: cdc
```

`validate` runs three offline checks — **structure** (schema: unknown fields /
types / enums), **reference closure** (referenced ids exist), and **capability
matrix** (mode × connector legality) — and every diagnostic carries a code, a
location, and a fix suggestion. Browse and document your workspace with `ls`,
`desc <id>`, and `explain <field>`; run `tapstate` with no arguments for an
offline REPL with Tab completion. All five offline verbs (`new` / `validate` /
`ls` / `desc` / `explain`) accept `-o json|yaml` for machine-readable output.

### Editor integration

The grammar ships as a standard JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) in the tree at
`core/core-schema/src/main/resources/schema/tapstate-v1.schema.json`. Associate
`*.tap.yml` with it for live validation, completion, and hover docs in any editor
backed by [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server):

```jsonc
// VS Code settings.json
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "/abs/path/to/tapstate/core/core-schema/src/main/resources/schema/tapstate-v1.schema.json": "*.tap.yml"
  }
}
```

### Preview runtime

Beyond the offline verbs, `connect` / `login` / `register` / `apply` /
`discover-schema` / `start` / `status` / `metrics` / `logs` (and friends) drive a
running tapstate server — see [docs/quickstart-online.md](docs/quickstart-online.md)
for the end-to-end flow (build → start a server → run a real sync). That runtime is
an early **preview** (single-node, in-memory); offline, without a connection, those
verbs exit with code `3`.
