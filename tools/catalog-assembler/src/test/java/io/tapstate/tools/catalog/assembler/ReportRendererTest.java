                ## Not derived — no built jar or did not classload (excluded from refresh)

                ## MQ suspects — derived cdc, undeclared (need tapstate.modes)
                - kafka

                ## Overlay divergences — our declaration differs from the connector's own
                - rabbitmq: upstream [cdc], ours [stream]

                ## Overlay not derivable — we declare a mode the capabilities do not support
                - selectdb: snapshot needs batch_read_function

                ## Sink semantics defaulted — no DML signal
                - kafka
