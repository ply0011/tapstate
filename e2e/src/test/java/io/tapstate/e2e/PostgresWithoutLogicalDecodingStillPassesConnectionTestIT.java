/**
 * A PostgreSQL that cannot do change data capture at all passes the product's connection test.
 *
 * <p>This documents behaviour rather than endorsing it, and it is written down because the behaviour is
 * easy to meet and hard to see. The image ships {@code wal_level=replica}, which serves physical
 * replication and not logical decoding, so no replication slot can ever be created on it. The
 * connector notices - it really does try to create one - but reports the failure as a warning, and the
 * product's overall outcome does not fail on warnings. So a user who points at such a server is told
 * the connection is fine, builds a pipeline on it, and finds out when the stream half fails.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the container is left at its defaults.</b> Every other PostgreSQL fixture here turns logical
 * decoding on, because they are about what the product does once it works. This one is about the server
 * nobody prepared, which is the one a first-time user actually has.
 *
 * <p><b>What this pins, and what it does not.</b> It pins today's contract: a warning-only test passes.
 * It takes no position on whether that is right - a failed change-data-capture probe arguably should
 * fail the test, and that judgement belongs with the plan that owns clean refusals, because the same
 * rule governs MySQL and changing it would change what existing MySQL users already see. What this test
 * guarantees is that the change cannot be made silently: whoever makes it will find this case red, with
 * the reasoning in front of them.
 *
 * <p>Needs Docker and the postgres connector jar.
