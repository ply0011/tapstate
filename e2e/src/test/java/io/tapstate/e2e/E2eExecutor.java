     * seed: a model is discovered from what the source holds, and the harness's seed is what
     * materializes the table - it drops and rewrites it, so before a seed there is nothing to discover.
     * Discovering an absent table returns an empty model and leaves the sink with no target and no key
     * to upsert on, quietly, because an empty model is what an empty source honestly looks like. And it
     * cannot follow the apply: a pipeline whose expression reads a row field is refused unless the
     * sources feeding it were discovered first, so an apply that ran before the discovery would be
     * refused rather than applied.
     *
     * <p>Which is why reading the resources is its own step. The seed dials the source's own address and
     * the discovery names its connector and settings - both stated only in the resource files, and both
     * needed before the product has been told anything at all.

     * <p>Listing it under {@code setup.apply} anyway is allowed and is what the checked-in examples do,
