/**
 * The witness that an applied resource can be removed, for every kind the grammar has, and that the
 * removal is real.
 *
 * <p>Real is the discriminating claim, and the listing is what carries it. A tombstone implementation
 * answers a removal exactly as a real one does and even answers the later read with "not found" - what it
 * cannot do is drop the row from the listing, because the row is still there to be filtered. So the
 * listing is asserted alongside the read, and asserting only that the removal call did not throw would
 * check neither.
 *
 * <p>Re-applying the id afterwards is the third assertion, and it is not a nicety. An id that is gone
 * from every read but still occupied is precisely what a tombstone leaves behind, and it is the state an
 * author meets as "I deleted it, why can I not recreate it" - the one symptom that reaches a user rather
 * than a maintainer. It also pins the promise the design made in place of a recycle bin: the way back is
 * to apply the document again.
 *
 * <p>All five kinds, in one launch. The verb is type-agnostic by construction, so the risk is not that
 * one kind takes a different code path but that one kind was never wired to the path at all - which is a
 * per-kind fact and cannot be witnessed by a case that only ever removes a source. They are removed in an
 * order the reference gate permits: a pipeline names its source, so the pipeline goes first and its source
 * is removed as part of the sweep that follows, not left as an exception.
 *
 * <p>Runs on the harness's own connector, so it needs Docker for the store and nothing else.
