/**
 * An upsert into a table its source declares no key for is refused, on a real database.
 *
 * <p>The unit cases prove the rule fires on the model it is handed. What they cannot prove is the step
 * before it: whether a real table without a primary key actually reaches the rule as a table without a
 * key. That answer belongs to the connector, which decides what counts as a key when it reports a
 * schema, and it is not the same answer on every engine — so it is settled here, against a real MySQL,
 * rather than assumed.
 *
 * <p>That step is what makes the second case worth its container, and it is the case that corrected
 * an assumption rather than confirming one. A table with no primary key but a unique index over a
 * non-null column can be upserted in principle - the unique column identifies the row. The connector
 * does not report it as keyed: it derives the key from a primary-key constraint alone, so such a
 * table arrives keyless and is refused. That refusal is known, deliberate for now, and deliberately
 * pinned here: the case asserts what happens today, so that widening the rule later shows up as this
 * test failing rather than as nobody noticing.
