/**
 * One PostgreSQL server for every specification in the JVM, the arrangement {@link SharedMySql} and
 * {@link SharedMongo} already make and for the same reason: a container per test class costs a start-up
 * each time and buys nothing, because runs stay independent by taking a database of their own rather
 * than a daemon of their own. Ryuk reaps the container when the JVM exits, so there is no stop to forget.
 *
 * <p>Started with logical decoding on, which is the one setting that cannot be added later. The image
 * ships {@code wal_level=replica}: a write-ahead log physical replication can follow and logical decoding
 * cannot. A change-data-capture read against that server does not fail where it is configured - it fails
 * much later, when the connector asks for a replication slot, and only the streaming half fails, so the
 * snapshot half of the same specification passes. Turning it on here means a case never meets that
 * half-working state.
 *
 * <p>Two settings differ from MySQL's arrangement and are worth naming, because both are the kind of
 * thing that reads as a connector defect when it is really a server that was never asked for it:
 * replication needs a sender slot per stream, and the defaults leave little headroom for a run that
 * opens a second one before the first is released.
 *
 * <p>Unlike MySQL, no privilege grant is needed. The image's own superuser is the account the harness
 * connects as, and it already carries the replication attribute; the MySQL equivalent exists only
 * because that image's default test user does not.
