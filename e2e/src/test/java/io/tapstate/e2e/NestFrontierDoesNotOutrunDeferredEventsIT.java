/**
 * A change the tree is holding for a parent that has not arrived survives a restart, even though the
 * frontier has already moved past it and the source will never send it again.
 *
 * <p>The frontier does not promise that everything below it has been emitted. It promises that everything
 * below it is either at a sink <em>or held somewhere it survives a restart from</em>. That is what lets a
 * child whose parent has not arrived be taken off the stream: it goes into this level's state, the state is
 * written through to a store, and the bound is free to pass it. Pinning the bound underneath it instead
 * would hold the source's read offset on a row that may never come and burn the source's retention window
 * while every count reads healthy.
 *
 * <p><b>That promise is only as good as its ordering, and only a restart can read it.</b> If the bound is
 * reported before the write-through has settled, nothing looks wrong: the child is still in memory, the
 * document is still correct, the counts are still healthy. The cost is paid later and once - a restart
 * resumes the source <em>above</em> that change, so it is never replayed, and it was never written down
 * either. It is gone from both places at once. The parent arrives afterwards and its document is built
 * without it: one element short, {@code error_count == 0}, {@code state} RUNNING, nothing to see.
 *
 * <p>So the assertions come in two halves and neither works alone:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Before the restart</b> - the frontier for the child's table moves while the child is still
 *       held. Without this the run never entered the state being tested: a level that kept the bound
 *       underneath its held child would make everything after it pass for the wrong reason, since the
 *       source would simply replay the change.</li>
 *   <li><b>After the restart</b> - the parent is inserted and its document contains the child. The child
 *       can only have come from durable state; the stream resumed above it. This is the half that fails
 *       when the bound ran ahead of the write.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The restart is a real one at both fidelities: the server handle is closed and a new one launched
 * against the same store, so the in-process tier drops its whole application context and the real-process
 * tier's process is destroyed. What comes back is a different server that has never seen this pipeline,
 * reading the same store - which is the situation being witnessed.
 *
 * <p>Gated on Docker and on a directory of real connector jars, like its siblings. Run it with:

 *   mvn -pl e2e -am verify -Dapi.version=1.44 \
