/**
 * The witness that runtime registration refuses a connector this release does not support, cleanly and
 * without keeping any of it.
 *
 * <p>The artifact is the harness's own connector packaged under an id nothing supports. It is well
 * formed in every other way - the same classes, manifest and specification shape the harness registers
 * successfully elsewhere - so the only reason to refuse it is the id, and a refusal here cannot be a
 * packaging accident wearing the right error code.
 *
 * <p>Two assertions, because either alone is satisfied by an outcome this test exists to exclude.
 * Asserting only the code leaves "refused, having already filed the bytes and half-loaded the
 * connector" indistinguishable from a clean refusal; asserting only the absence leaves a bare crash
 * that stored nothing looking like a pass. The status is part of the first: a coded refusal answers a
 * request error, while an uncaught failure would answer a server error with no code at all.
 *
 * <p>Both fidelity tiers. The accepted set is widenable per deployment and the harness widens it - to
 * its own synthetic id and nothing else - so this also pins that the widening stays narrow in the
 * shipped boot jar, where it arrives as a command-line argument rather than a property set in this JVM.
 *
 * <p>Needs Docker for the store, and nothing else: no connector jars are staged for it, so unlike the
 * real-connector witnesses this one runs in an ordinary build.

     * an independent database product is not - however similar its wire protocol, its change capture is
     * its own mechanism and nothing here has been run against it.
     *
     * <p>These ids are the confusable ones, which is the whole reason they are named through the real
     * control plane rather than left to the unit that already sweeps the full list. {@code mariadb}
     * ends in a supported id, {@code tidb} speaks the same protocol as one, and {@code open-gauss} is a
     * fork of another. A guard implemented as a prefix or substring test refuses the harness's own
     * obviously-foreign id above while admitting all three of these, so this is the case that separates
     * "the set is checked" from "the set is a set".
     *
     * <p>One tier, unlike the case above. What differs per tier is where the widening arrives from, and
     * that is already pinned; what differs per id is the guard's own reading of the id, which does not
     * depend on how the server was launched. Sweeping both axes at once would multiply container runs
     * for no assertion neither one already makes.
     *
     * <p>No "nothing is filed under it" assertion here, and the reason is worth writing down because the
     * obvious version of it passes for the wrong reason. The catalog listing answers with registered
     * rows and bundled ones alike, and every id named here is bundled - the product knows these
     * connectors exist, it simply will not accept an artifact for one. So asserting the id is absent
     * from that listing fails against a correct server, and asserting it is present would witness
     * nothing. The clean-refusal half is carried by the case above, whose id is bundled nowhere.
