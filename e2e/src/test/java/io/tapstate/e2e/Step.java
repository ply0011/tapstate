 * One stage of a specification. Steps run in declaration order; the order is the scenario.

 * {@code resume}, {@code stop} - and carry the product's own verb enum, so neither the word nor the
 * value can drift from what the product accepts. {@code run} is deliberately not a step: the
 * product already reserves it for a different meaning, apply-then-start.
 *
 * <p>There is no rewind step: re-snapshotting is the explicit {@code stop} then {@code start} pair,
 * which is exactly what the product's verb set offers.
