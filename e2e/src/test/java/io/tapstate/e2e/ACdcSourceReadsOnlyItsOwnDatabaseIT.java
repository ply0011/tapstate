/**
 * A source reads changes from the database it names, and from no other database on the same server.
 *
 * <p>A MySQL server keeps one binary log for all of its databases. A change-capture source therefore
 * reads a stream carrying every database's changes and has to decide which of them are its own. Deciding
 * that on the table name alone is enough to look correct on any single-database machine and on every
 * example that runs by itself - two databases only ever collide when both hold a table of the same name,
 * which is exactly what happens when the same specification runs twice against two databases of its own.
 *
 * <p>This is a question about the product, asked directly, because the shape it was found in could not
 * answer it. Two runs of one example leaked a value between them; the store and the source database were
 * measured to be separate for each, which left the shared server as the only path and the binary log as
 * the only mechanism - a narrowing, not a demonstration. So: one server, two databases, the same table
 * name in both, a pipeline told to read exactly one of them.
 *
 * <p>What the assertions have to discriminate:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The negative alone proves nothing.</b> A pipeline that died at start-up, or never reached its
 *       change stream, also fails to deliver the other database's change - and would pass a test that
 *       only checked the target had not moved. So the run first proves change capture is live by changing
 *       the watched database and seeing that arrive.</li>
 *   <li><b>Then the unwatched database is changed</b>, to a value nothing else in the run ever writes, and
 *       the target is held to the watched value for a bounded wait. A value that could arrive from
 *       anywhere would not say where it came from; this one can only have come across the database
 *       boundary.</li>
 *   <li><b>The row is read whole</b> rather than counted. The two databases hold the same ids, so a leak
 *       rewrites a row rather than adding one, and no count would move.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Gated on Docker and on real connector jars, like every real-connector witness. Run it with:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   mvn -pl e2e -am verify -Dapi.version=1.44 \
