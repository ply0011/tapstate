/**
 * The three data-browser verbs projected onto HTTP: list a declared source's collections, read one
 * collection's rows, report one collection's size. Each drives the control-core service, which resolves
 * the source to the connection its reads run on and drives the whitelisted runtime probe. A thin
 * projection with no business logic of its own; the service speaks control-ring types, so this face never
 * reaches into the storage ports.
 *
 * <p>They read through to the connector and persist nothing, not even the result, so all three are
 * read-scoped and unaudited — that is what separates them from the two connection probes, which look
 * similar but store what they found. The grade is the registry's, not the HTTP method's: the read is
 * posted because it carries a request body, not because it changes anything.
 *
 * <p>Every call stands alone. The read is one-shot, so no continuation state travels in either direction:
 * nothing in the request names a position to resume from, and nothing in the response offers one. What
 * the response does carry is whether more rows remain — the only thing separating a preview of ten from a
 * collection of ten.
 *
 * <p>Which database a read reaches is settled by the source's own connection. Neither path nor body has a
 * field for one, so nothing a caller sends can move a read off the connection it was resolved from.
