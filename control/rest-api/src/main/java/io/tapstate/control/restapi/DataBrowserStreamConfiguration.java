/**
 * Mounts the followed-collection stream at {@code /api/data-browser/{source}/{collection}/tail}.
 *
 * <p>Its own configuration rather than a third entry beside the two pipeline streams, and the reason
 * is not tidiness. This channel needs the read service, and putting it there would have made every
 * context that mounts a status watch also have to supply one — which is exactly what happened: two
 * unrelated contexts failed to start, neither of which has any interest in reading data. A stream
 * family that carries rows and one that carries pipeline observations have no reason to be assembled
 * together, and keeping them apart is what lets each be present only where it is wanted.
 *
 * <p>It also shares no scheduler with them, which is the load-bearing half. Those two hand their
 * polling to a small shared pool; a follow is a blocking read that never returns, so a couple of
 * follows on that pool would leave every status watch and log follow in the process frozen with
 * nothing reporting it. A follow instead rides the thread its subscription brought.
