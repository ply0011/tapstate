/**
 * Resolves a presented credential to a verified token, routing by the credential's own shape so the two
 * authentication mechanisms converge on one {@link VerifiedToken}. A credential carrying the machine-token
 * scheme prefix ({@code cyxt_}) is authenticated against the revocable token store; anything else is
 * verified as a stateless signed session token. So a {@code --token} machine credential and a {@code login}
 * session credential look identical to the dispatcher once resolved — it authorizes the grade, not the
 * mechanism.
 *
 * <p>A bad credential is never an exception, only an absence: a malformed, unknown, revoked, expired or
 * unsigned credential resolves to empty, and the surface turns that into an unauthenticated refusal. The
 * routing is by prefix and therefore exclusive — a machine token is never verified as a session token, and
 * a session token never touches the token store — so neither mechanism can be probed through the other.
