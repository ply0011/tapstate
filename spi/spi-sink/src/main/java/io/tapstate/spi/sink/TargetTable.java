/**
 * The resolved model of the table a sink writes to: its name and its fields in order. An immutable
 * value the sink turns into the store's own table descriptor — the fields become columns, and the
 * fields flagged {@link TargetField#primaryKey} become the key an upsert matches on, in field order.
 *
 * <p>This is the write-side target model, already resolved (renames applied, primary key chosen), not
 * the source model as discovered. {@code fields} is held as an unmodifiable defensive copy; a null
 * list is normalized to empty. An empty field list leaves the target structure to the connector.
 *
 * <p>Serializable so a resolved model travels with the sink factory the engine ships onto the DAG.
